## Introduction
AutoPhoneCaller is an application which allows you to trigger your phone to make a phone call based on appropriate code word via SMS and caller ID, as long as the app running in the backgournd (and not terminated by the phone owner).
Since I couldn't find a simple application with these capabilities, i thought to myself it will be cool to automate this process for me instead
of asking a friend to make the phone call himself (or to make the phone all myself), and that's how the idea was born.
